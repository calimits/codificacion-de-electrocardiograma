# ❤️ ECG Encoder & Decoder

University project focused on the **encoding and decoding of electrocardiograms (ECG)** to practice **analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)**.  
The application demonstrates how different bit depths affect the quality of the digital signal compared to the original analog waveform.

## 🧩 Problem
Electrocardiograms are analog signals that must be digitized for storage, analysis, and transmission.  
The challenge was to understand how **different levels of quantization (bit depth)** impact the fidelity of the ECG signal.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project implements an interactive web application that:
- Encodes ECG signals using varying bit depths.  
- Decodes and reconstructs the signal for visualization.  
- Compares the quality of the reconstructed signal against the original.  
- Provides a clear demonstration of the trade-off between **precision** and **storage efficiency**.

## ⚙️ Project Features
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript  
- **Architecture demonstrated:**  
  - Component-based design in React  
  - Signal visualization through dynamic rendering  
  - Clean separation of logic and UI

## 🚀 Main Functionalities
- Upload or simulate ECG signals.  
- Encode signals with different bit depths (e.g., 8-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit).  
- Decode and visualize reconstructed signals.  
- Compare signal quality across different quantization levels.
